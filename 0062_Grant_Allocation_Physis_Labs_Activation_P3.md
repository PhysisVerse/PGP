## Summary

This proposal seeks approval to allocate a continuation grant of **10T USDC** to **Physis Labs** for **Activation P3**, extending the Activation Phase beyond the initial beta stabilization window. As testing continues and the network matures, this tranche supports sustained refinement, reliability improvements, and structured progression toward full public launch.

Activation P3 represents a measured continuation of the Activation framework established in PGP60 and PGP61. The objective is to ensure the system exits the beta “weeds” with stability, operator confidence, and repeatable deployment processes.

## Impact

* **Why Now:**

  * Beta onboarding is ongoing and real-world usage continues to surface edge cases.
  * A controlled extension of the Activation Phase prevents premature scaling.

* **Opportunities:**

  * Harden network behavior under expanding beta participation.
  * Improve operational clarity and documentation before public rollout.
  * Solidify SmartSpot + SYNCRAL as stable production systems.

* **Challenges:**

  * Extended beta periods can fatigue contributors if not structured properly.
  * Discipline is required to refine rather than expand scope.

* **Future Vision:**

  * Completion of Activation P3 transitions Physis from beta activation into formal public launch readiness.

## Explanation

* **Implementation Overview:**

  * DAO will allocate **10T USDC** to Physis Labs to support:

    * Continued beta onboarding and operator support
    * Stability and reliability tuning under live conditions
    * Iterative firmware and software refinements
    * Documentation consolidation and deployment standardization
    * SmartSpot Thor sourcing and production coordination

* **Practical Examples:**

  * Addressing performance bottlenecks identified during expanded testing.
  * Improving update propagation reliability across deployed nodes.
  * Preparing standardized onboarding scripts for eventual public users.

* **Addressing Corner Cases:**

  * Any unused funds will be carried forward or returned to Treasury subject to Council review.

## Queries

* **Pre-Merge Resolutions:**

  * Confirm grant amount for Activation P3: **10T USDC**.
  * Define updated checkpoint timeline (mid-to-late February or beyond as required).

* **Dependencies and Timelines:**

  * Activation P3 begins immediately following Activation P2.
  * Phase concludes upon Council-confirmed stabilization metrics being met.

---

## Metrics

* **Performance Indicators:**

  * Increased beta operator stability and reduced incident rate.
  * Improved onboarding completion rate.
  * Network uptime consistency across testing period.

* **User Acceptance:**

  * Sustained beta operator engagement and readiness for public expansion.
