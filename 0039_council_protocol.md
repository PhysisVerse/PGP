# PGP39: Council Governance Protocol

## Introduction

This protocol outlines the initial roles, responsibilities, incentives, and terms under which Council and Members operate within Physis DAO ("the DAO"). It serves to ensure a mutual understanding of expectations and to foster a transparent, efficient, and collaborative environment that serves the community and supports the DAO's objectives.

## The Mission

- **Decision-Making:** Council members are responsible for making informed decisions on governance, strategy, and critical operational issues.
- **Community Engagement:** Members will actively engage with the community, representing their interests and ensuring transparency in governance processes.
- **Agility in Critical Situations:** The Council will prioritise swift action on urgent matters, with decisions made in the best interest of the DAO's health and security.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Council Members are expected to:

- Actively participate in Council meetings and discussions.
- To be on alert for critical matters the DAO must immediately attend to.
- Make informed decisions that align with the DAO's mission and best interests.
- Contribute to the DAO's governance, including proposal reviews and voting.
- Engage with the broader community to represent the Council's initiatives and feedback.
- Uphold the DAO's values and standards of conduct.

## Council Composition

- The Council consists of founding members and selected community representatives, ensuring a mix of strategic vision and community voices.
- Members serve a term of 24 months, with the option for re-election to foster continuity and fresh perspectives.
- Semipermanent members consist of founders and volunteer team members yet remain subject to common review based on performance and conduct.

## Decision-Making Process

- Routine decisions require a simple majority, while significant changes or strategic decisions require a supermajority of 75% approval.
- The Council commits to timely responses, aiming to address urgent matters within 6 hours.

## Accountability and Evolution

- Council members are accountable to the DAO community, with mechanisms in place for feedback and, if necessary, recall based on performance or misconduct.
- The governance framework will be revisited regularly, allowing for adjustments and refinements to align with the DAO's growth and evolving needs.

## Term and Removal

- Members serve for a 24 month term, with the possibility of renewal based on performance and community trust.
- A Member may be removed by a majority vote of the Council for failing to meet responsibilities, misconduct, or any action deemed harmful to the DAO.
- The process for removal shall involve a 3 day review period, during which the Member in question will have the opportunity to respond to concerns raised.
- Members can retire if they no longer wish to serve, with a 3 month grace period allowing the Council to appoint a replacing Member.

## Incentive System

As the Council serves with a mission critical responsibility with the DAO, there will be a fair and balanced incentive system established that values all contributions:

- Vested allocation of 72T PHY from the DAO Treasury per Council Member.
- Monthly emissions of 6% over the full course of a Members 24 month term.
- Council Members can opt to lock their emissions with an 8% annual reward.
- Rewards are subject to review and adjustment by the DAO's governance process.
- The Council can agree to discontinue Member Incentives if Protocol is violated or if the Member decides to retire.
- The intial warm-up phase for vested emissions will be 1 month from the approval of this Protocol.

## Protocol Agreement

By accepting the position of a Council Member, the Member agrees adhere to the terms outlined in this Protocol, to act in the best interests of the DAO, and to uphold the principles and responsibilities of their role.

## Amendments

This protocol can be amended through the DAO's governance process, with proposed changes subject to Council review and approval.

## Conclusion

This initial protocol is designed to be straightforward yet effective, laying the foundation for robust governance. As the DAO evolves, so too will its governance structures, always with an eye towards inclusivity, transparency, and efficiency.
