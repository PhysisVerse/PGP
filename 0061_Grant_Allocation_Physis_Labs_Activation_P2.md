## Summary

This proposal seeks approval to allocate a continuation grant of **10T USDC** to **Physis Labs** for **Activation P2**, extending the Activation Phase through the **start of February**. This tranche continues execution from Activation P1, with emphasis on stabilization, operator retention, and conversion of early activity into sustained network usage.

  * Validate uptime, monitoring, and update cycles under sustained use.
  * Transition from initial activation to predictable operations.

* **Challenges:**

  * Early-stage networks require careful tuning to avoid fatigue or instability.
  * Scope discipline is required to avoid premature expansion.
