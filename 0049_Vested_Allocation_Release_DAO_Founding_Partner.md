## Summary

This proposal seeks approval to release **6.5M PHY** from the DAO’s Reserve Treasury to a Founding Partner in exchange for **403 SOL**. As in previous rounds, this funding marks another stage of capital-backed expansion, enabling the DAO to continue scaling development and governance activities.

---

## Impact

- **Why Now:**
  - An additional 403 SOL injection will strengthen the Physis DAO’s capacity to fund R&D and ecosystem initiatives without delay.
  - Delaying this infusion could slow ongoing feature rollouts and reduce the DAO’s competitive advantage.

- **Opportunities:**
  - Immediate capital to sustain and scale the DAO’s core mission through grants, development, and community growth.
  - Reinforces the Founding Partner’s ongoing commitment to the DAO’s long-term success.

- **Challenges:**
  - Allocating 6.5M PHY can raise concerns about dilution and potential market impact.
  - The DAO must ensure proper vesting measures (18-month lock followed by 18-month vest) to prevent sudden sell-offs or governance imbalance.

- **Future Vision:**
  - This additional capital will bolster development pipelines and accelerate cross-ecosystem collaborations.
  - A successful deployment helps pave the way for further expansions and solidifies stakeholder confidence.

## Stakeholders

- **Affected Parties:**
  - **PHY & ASTRALIS Holders**: Potential impact on circulating supply and market dynamics.
  - **Community Developers & Physis Labs**: Gains extra resources to advance the ecosystem roadmap.
  - **Founding Partner**: Receives a premium PHY allocation aligned with ongoing early-stage development.

- **Engagement for Feedback:**
  - Proposal posted in the Council forum for open discussion.
  - Council Q&A session to gather direct input on this new round.
  - Written feedback collected from key contributors and community members.

## Explanation

- **Concept Introduction:**
  - This proposal allocates **6.5M** PHY from the DAO Reserve Treasury at a “premium” rate in return for 403 SOL.
  - The same Founding Partner continues to support the DAO’s mission, reinforcing collaboration and governance participation.

- **Implementation Overview:**
  - Upon approval, the DAO Reserve Treasury will vest **6.5M** PHY.
  - The Founding Partner deposits 403 SOL in the DAO’s Reserve Treasury.
  - A lock-up schedule prevents immediate liquidation—**18-month hold, then 18-month linear vest** (36 months total), consistent with prior agreements.

- **Practical Examples:**
  - If PHY’s baseline is \$0.02, the “premium” effectively values PHY at around \$0.015 (subject to final calculations).
  - Over the vesting period, the Founding Partner gradually unlocks PHY while maintaining a stake in the DAO.
  - Any newly released PHY can remain in the Rewards program until fully unlocked.

- **Addressing Corner Cases:**
  - If the Founding Partner does not deliver 403 SOL, the allocation is reversed.
  - If PHY’s market price changes drastically, the reference value is the time the DAO Treasury receives the SOL.

---

## Pitfalls

- **Reasons for Hesitation:**
  - Concerns about increasing the Founding Partner’s share in governance or market influence.
  - Another premium round could set expectations for future deals.

- **Potential Problems:**
  - An inadequate vesting period might lead to undue market pressure upon token unlock.
  - Misalignment if the Founding Partner’s approach shifts away from the DAO’s long-term strategy.

---

## Rationale

- **Optimal Design Justification:**
  - Offering a second premium allocation follows the same early-stage incentive strategy as previous rounds.
  - **6.5M** PHY is smaller than the initial allocation but still meaningful enough to drive expansions.
  - Continuity in terms from the last vesting cycle ensures consistency and predictability for the DAO and partner.

- **Considered Alternatives:**
  - Seeking new external contributors, which requires extra vetting and could delay the DAO’s development timeline.
  - Restricting future rounds to new backers only, forfeiting deeper engagement from an existing, trusted supporter.

- **Consequences of Inaction:**
  - Slower or halted ecosystem growth if the DAO remains capital-constrained.
  - Missed opportunities for synergy and scaling in 2025 and beyond.

---

## Queries

- **Pre-Merge Resolutions:**
  - Confirm vesting details match the standard 18-month lock + 18-month linear vest.
  - Validate governance rights if any changes occur due to increased PHY holdings.

- **Post-Approval Developments:**
  - Deploy or update vesting contracts on-chain for transparency.
  - Provide periodic updates on how this extra SOL accelerates the DAO’s roadmap.

- **Future Considerations:**
  - Option for additional capital infusions if all parties remain satisfied with progress.
  - Continue monitoring overall PHY distribution to prevent excessive concentration.

- **Dependencies and Timelines:**
  - Receipt of 403 SOL in the Reserve Treasury prior to releasing 6.5M PHY.
  - Smart contract vesting schedule implemented within 24 hours of SOL arrival.

---

## Deployment

- **User Impact:**
  - Possible slight dilution, but intended to boost core strategic initiatives.
  - Accelerated development benefits for the broader community.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Record the newly vested 6.5M PHY in on-chain logs and governance documentation.
  - Update tokenomics references to reflect the second round’s parameters.

- **Compatibility Considerations:**
  - This proposal mirrors previous allocations, preserving existing governance and workflow structures.
  - No migration strategy needed unless vesting differs significantly from the initial round.

- **Reversibility:**
  - Once PHY is locked and the vesting schedule begins, reversal would require renegotiation.
  - The lock-up mitigates immediate release concerns.

- **Migration Strategy:**
  - Not applicable. This is an additional discrete allocation, not a protocol change.

## Metrics

- **Performance Indicators:**
  - Increased capital for R&D and roadmap execution.
  - Continued or improved velocity of ecosystem deliverables (commits, new features).

- **Stability Metrics:**
  - DAO Treasury retains adequate reserves for other initiatives.
  - Market liquidity for PHY remains stable with no major disruptions.

- **Complexity Reduction:**
  - Maintaining an ongoing relationship with an established supporter avoids overhead in sourcing new partners.

- **User Acceptance:**
  - Assessed via forum discussion, vote outcomes, and feedback during or after implementation.
  - Positive reception backed by tangible project updates.

- **ETL Reporting Needs:**
  - Track usage of the additional 403 SOL.
  - Monitor vesting progress and impact on the DAO’s broader metrics.
