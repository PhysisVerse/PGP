## Summary

This proposal seeks approval to release an allocation of **205,700 PHY** from the DAO’s Reserve Treasury to a Founder Origin with a stake of  **45.635 SOL**. This contribution represents a new strategic alignment at an early stage of DAO development. The allocation will be vested over 24 months to align long-term participation and governance continuity.

---

## Impact

* **Why Now:**

  * This contribution brings added capital into the DAO at a time when Q2 deliverables are underway.
  * Strategic alignment with an engaged partner strengthens ecosystem participation and optional governance capacity.

* **Opportunities:**

  * Strengthens the DAO’s treasury and financial resilience.
  * Brings in an additional participant aligned with the DAO’s mission.

* **Challenges:**

  * Community sensitivity around vesting allocations and DAO-level representation.
  * Need for consistent documentation across partner rounds.

* **Future Vision:**

  * Continued expansion of the DAO treasury and aligned governance layer.
  * Positioning for long-term collaborative growth and infrastructure decentralization.

## Stakeholders

* **Affected Parties:**

  * **PHY Holders**: Potential dilution offset by stronger treasury.
  * **DAO Community**: Gains a new mission-aligned participant.
  * **New Partner**: Receives vested governance-aligned stake.

* **Engagement for Feedback:**

  * Forum discussion to align on allocation and governance privileges.
  * Q\&A in Matrix prior to final vote.

## Explanation

* **Concept Introduction:**

  * This proposal follows the same model as previous Founder  allocations.
  * The Founder Origin contributes **45.635 SOL** and receives a governance-aligned PHY stake with standard DAO vesting conditions.

* **Implementation Overview:**

  * Upon receipt of SOL in the DAO Treasury, **205,700 PHY** will be vested over a **24-month period** (12-month hold + 12-month linear vest).
  * The contribution will be recorded and announced in DAO Founder logs.

* **Practical Examples:**

  * If PHY’s baseline is \$0.04, this “premium” effectively sets a contribution rate of \$0.036.
  * Over the vesting period, the Founding Partner receives portions of PHY until fully unlocked after 24 months.
  * Released PHY will remain locked with the PHY Rewards program until the Founding Partner wishes to unlock their allocation.

* **Addressing Corner Cases:**

  * If SOL is not received, the allocation will be void.
  * Any changes in partner governance tier (e.g., PRIVÉ) must be confirmed by the Council.
  * If PHY’s market value changes drastically during the proposal period, the reference value is the time of receipt of SOL in the DAO Reserve Treasury.

## Pitfalls

* **Reasons for Hesitation:**

  * Concerns around cumulative DAO partner influence.
  * Transparency expectations must remain high to ensure fairness.

* **Potential Problems:**

  * Market volatility may impact perceived value of the transaction.
  * Need to maintain vesting enforcement through contracts.

---

## Rationale

* **Optimal Design Justification:**

  * Repeatable partner vesting models ensure fairness and scalability.
  * The SOL contribution strengthens the treasury while vesting ensures long-term alignment.

* **Considered Alternatives:**

  * One-off contributions without vesting—rejected to preserve consistency.
  * Lower tier access without participation—rejected due to strong alignment.

* **Consequences of Inaction:**

  * Missed opportunity to expand treasury and governance network.
  * Undermines momentum from prior partner contributions.

---

## Queries

* **Pre-Merge Resolutions:**

  * Confirm final premium-adjusted allocation (e.g., 10% = 205,700 PHY).
  * Confirm if any specific role or tier is associated with this partner.

* **Post-Approval Developments:**

  * Add partner to treasury contribution log.
  * Initiate vesting schedule and governance key sync (if applicable).

* **Future Considerations:**

  * Evaluate DAO partner expansion strategy.
  * Ensure quarterly reporting of treasury inflows from partner rounds.

* **Dependencies and Timelines:**

  * SOL must be received prior to allocation release.
  * Vesting contract deployed within 48 hours of receipt.

---

## Deployment

* **User Impact:**

  * No direct user impact outside of treasury strengthening.
  * May support downstream grants and operations.

* **Documentation Updates:**

  * Add to DAO partner log and treasury intake history.
  * Reflect allocation in partner governance overview.

* **Compatibility Considerations:**

  * No protocol-level change.

* **Reversibility:**

  * Fully reversible prior to vesting contract deployment.

* **Migration Strategy:**

  * Not applicable.
