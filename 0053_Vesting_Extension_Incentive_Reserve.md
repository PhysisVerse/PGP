## Summary

This proposal seeks approval to allocate a dedicated **PHY incentive reserve** from the DAO’s Reserve Treasury to support **vesting contract extensions**. This reserve will be used to incentivize vested governance—primarily Founders and strategic contributors—to **extend their original vesting timelines**, reinforcing long-term alignment and reducing near-term token liquidity.

---

## Impact

* **Why Now:**

  * Several original vesting contracts are approaching maturity or scheduled unlock phases.
  * Offering opt-in extensions backed by new incentive PHY encourages continued alignment and retention.

* **Opportunities:**

  * Reduce short-term unlock pressure and potential sell pressure.
  * Increase DAO stability and capital continuity through renewed participant commitment.

* **Challenges:**

  * Extension must be compelling enough to attract voluntary participation.
  * Overuse of incentives could create inflation or dilute future grant pools.

* **Future Vision:**

  * Optional extension incentives become a structured tool for maintaining stakeholder alignment—especially as PHY matures into a more governance-weighted asset.
  * DAO participants increasingly orient around long-term timelines, governance continuity, and ecosystem growth.

---

## Stakeholders

* **Affected Parties:**

  * **Current Founders and strategic partners** with active vesting contracts.
  * **DAO Treasury**: Source of the incentive PHY.
  * **DAO Community**: Gains a more stable and long-term-aligned contributor base.

* **Engagement for Feedback:**

  * Discuss draft ranges for incentive % in Council forum.
  * Q\&A for stakeholders considering extension paths.

---

## Explanation

* **Concept Introduction:**

  * This proposal introduces a dedicated incentive reserve of **10M PHY** to be offered to stakeholders who voluntarily extend their existing vesting contracts.

* **Implementation Overview:**

  * Allocation to be kept in a DAO-controlled incentive pool.
  * PHY from this pool may be offered at fixed or tiered rates based on length of extension (e.g., 6, 12, or 18 additional months).
  * All incentives subject to DAO approval and on-chain contract extension.

* **Practical Examples:**

  * A Founder whose vesting ends in July 2025 agrees to extend by 12 months. In return, they receive an additional X PHY (determined by DAO formula or Council discretion).

* **Addressing Corner Cases:**

  * Participants who decline to extend are unaffected.
  * Over-subscription may require Council to cap incentive PHY offered per extension.

---

## Pitfalls

* **Reasons for Hesitation:**

  * Perceived as rewarding delay or indecision.
  * May be seen as a short-term fix rather than structural alignment.

* **Potential Problems:**

  * Tracking is fully supported by our existing vesting infrastructure. Each contract is tied to a known account, and in many cases, a named or direct contact. Our provider maintains a detailed ledger of all original and extended contracts.
  * All incentive distributions will be tracked and approved through Council-reviewed logs and contract audits.

---

## Rationale

* **Optimal Design Justification:**

  * Extending already-vested participants is more efficient than recruiting new capital.
  * Reduces circulating supply while deepening alignment.

* **Considered Alternatives:**

  * Let all vesting expire on original schedule—misses opportunity to retain aligned partners.
  * Extend with no incentives—unlikely to gain voluntary uptake.

* **Consequences of Inaction:**

  * Large unlocks in short time windows may increase volatility.
  * Aligned contributors may disengage without reason to stay involved.

---

## Queries

* **Pre-Merge Resolutions:**

  * Determine total PHY to allocate to the reserve, estimated based on expected participation across the three Founder tiers.
  * Define tiered model: Founder Partner, Founder Vanguard, and Founder Origin participants may receive between 5–10% additional PHY for a 12-month extension, with smaller allocations and timelines applied proportionally for lower tiers.

* **Post-Approval Developments:**

  * Set up Council-reviewed intake process for extension requests.
  * Publish transparent logs of who extends and what PHY is awarded.

* **Future Considerations:**

  * Evaluate effectiveness of incentive model for broader use.
  * Use extension participation as one filter for PRIVÉ or other advanced roles.

* **Dependencies and Timelines:**

  * Initial reserve of 10M PHY should be live by May 31, 2025 to match early expiries. Any unused portion will be returned to the Reserve Treasury via Council resolution.
  * Incentive offers reviewed monthly by Council.

---

## Deployment

* **User Impact:**

  * Eligible participants may opt in to extensions with clear terms.
  * No disruption to those not extending.

* **Documentation Updates:**

  * Add section to DAO vesting docs outlining the extension incentive model.
  * Publish ongoing extension participation log.

* **Compatibility Considerations:**

  * Requires no protocol-level changes.

* **Reversibility:**

  * Reserve may be reduced or sunset via future proposal.

* **Migration Strategy:**

  * Not applicable.

## Metrics

* **Performance Indicators:**

  * % of eligible contracts extended.
  * Amount of circulating PHY reduced or delayed.

* **Stability Metrics:**

  * Treasury liquidity vs. new emission pacing.

* **Complexity Reduction:**

  * Centralized reserve simplifies negotiations for multiple extension paths.

* **User Acceptance:**

  * Participation rate among eligible contracts.
  * Community sentiment tracked via forum feedback.

* **ETL Reporting Needs:**

  * Weekly tracking of extended contracts and incentive emissions.
  * Running tally of PHY distributed from this reserve.
