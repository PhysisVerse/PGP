## Summary

This proposal seeks approval to allocate a continuation grant of **11T USDC** to **Physis Labs** for the **Activation Transition Phase**, marking the shift from extended Activation cycles into structured public launch readiness and shipment execution over the next two weeks.

While still aligned with the Activation framework established in PGP60–PGP62, this proposal formally initiates the transition from beta stabilization into controlled ship mode.

  * Begin structured shipment and wider onboarding.
  * Demonstrate disciplined transition from testing to execution.

* **Challenges:**

  * Launch transitions require careful coordination across hardware, firmware, documentation, and operator support.
  * Public release increases visibility and scrutiny.

* **Future Vision:**

  * Successful completion of the Launch Transition Phase positions Physis for sustained network growth beyond early adopter cycles.
