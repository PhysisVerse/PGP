## Summary

This proposal seeks approval to release **25.6M PHY** from the DAO’s Reserve Treasury to a strategic Founding Partner contributing **1683.56 SOL**. This funding marks a new stage for the project, moving the DAO from a pre-build phase to a more formal, capital-backed expansion.

---

## Impact

- **Why Now:**
  - This influx of SOL will allow the Physis DAO to advance development without delay.
  - Delaying further capital infusion will stall growth and prolong timelines.

- **Opportunities:**
  - Immediate infusion to sustain and scale the DAO and its ability to grant to its core mission.
  - Improved community standing and network opportunities through Founding Partner connections.

- **Challenges:**
  - Releasing 25.6M PHY can raise concerns about dilution and market stability.
  - The DAO must ensure proper vesting/lock-up measures to protect against immediate sell-offs.

- **Future Vision:**
  - With this capital, the DAO can accelerate R&D and broader ecosystem initiatives, strengthening the position of Physis and its governance.
  - A successful deployment of these resources can pave the way for additional expansions and accelerated growth.

## Stakeholders

- **Affected Parties:**
  - **PHY & ASTRALIS Holders**: Potential impact on circulating supply, governance, and market activity.
  - **Community Developers & Physis Labs**: Anticipated grant of resources to drive ecosystem development.
  - **Founding Partner**: Receives a premium PHY allocation aligned with early-stage DAO development.

- **Engagement for Feedback:**
  - Publish proposal for discussion in Council forum.
  - Council Q&A session for direct input.
  - Gather written feedback from key contributors.

---

## Explanation

- **Concept Introduction:**
  - This proposal allocates **25.6M** PHY. The arrangement rewards the Founding Partner for contributing at an early, pre-build stage and incentivizes long-term collaboration and governance participation.

- **Implementation Overview:**
  - Upon approval, the DAO Reserve Treasury will provide vested **25.6M** PHY.
  - The Founding Partner deposits 1683.56 SOL in the DAO’s Reserve Treasury.
  - A lock-up schedule prevents the Founding Partner from immediately liquidating PHY. Suggested structure: an 18-month hold followed by an 18-month vest, for a total 36-month period plus PHY Rewards program participation.

- **Practical Examples:**
  - If PHY’s baseline is \$0.02, this “premium” effectively sets a contribution rate of \$0.015.
  - Over the vesting period, the Founding Partner receives portions of PHY until fully unlocked after 36 months.
  - Released PHY will remain locked with the PHY Rewards program until the Founding Partner wishes to unlock their allocation.

- **Addressing Corner Cases:**
  - If the Founding Partner does not deposit SOL, the DAO will reverse the allocation.
  - If PHY’s market value changes drastically during the proposal period, the reference value is the time of receipt of SOL in the DAO Reserve Treasury.

---

## Pitfalls

- **Reasons for Hesitation:**
  - Some community members may worry about a single large allocation, fearing potential governance centralization or sell pressure.
  - An early-stage premium might be seen as setting a precedent for future deals.

- **Potential Problems:**
  - An inadequate vesting period could lead to sudden market impact.
  - Misalignment of goals if the Founding Partner approach diverges from the DAO’s long-term vision.

---

## Rationale

- **Optimal Design Justification:**
  - Offering a premium is a common practice to reward participation at a pre-build stage of development.
  - **25.6M** PHY represents a meaningful but not excessive slice of the Reserve Treasury for the funding the DAO needs to grow.
  - Governance centralization is not possible due to how the DAO functions via its approved protocol.

- **Considered Alternatives:**
  - Proposing a smaller allocation at a lower premium, but that might not secure enough capital for the next critical development phase.
  - Multiple micro-contributors rather than a single strategic partner, which could complicate administration.

- **Consequences of Inaction:**
  - Physis, as a whole, may continue with constrained capital, slowing progress and prolonging timelines.

---

## Queries

- **Pre-Merge Resolutions:**
  - Finalize vesting schedule specifics (e.g., 18-month lock, 18-month monthly distribution).
  - Confirm Founding Partner governance privileges as pertains to PRIVÉ layer protocol.

- **Post-Approval Developments:**
  - Deploy the vesting contract on-chain.
  - Provide quarterly updates on how the SOL accelerates development.

- **Future Considerations:**
  - Potential to open another allocation round if demand grows or additional capital is needed.
  - Evaluating stable approaches for subsequent opportunities with other contributors.

- **Dependencies and Timelines:**
  - Founding Partner’s SOL to arrive in the Reserve Treasury prior to releasing PHY.
  - Smart contract work to be completed within 24 hours of receipt.

---

## Deployment

- **User Impact:**
  - PHY holders may see slight dilution, but the aim is to boost long-term growth.
  - Grants to Physis Labs and other mission-aligned entities can accelerate hiring, ecosystem development, and releases.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Tokenomics references should be updated to reflect this allocation and vesting.
  - Add references to the new smart contract addresses in governance docs.

- **Compatibility Considerations:**
  - This proposal does not alter existing user flows; it simply assigns more PHY to a vesting schedule.
  - Reversal post-deployment is difficult without a buyback or burn mechanic.

- **Reversibility:**
  - Once PHY is released and vesting commences, reversing would require renegotiation.
  - The lock-up mitigates risks of abrupt distribution.

- **Migration Strategy:**
  - Not applicable, as this is a one-time allocation rather than a structural overhaul.

## Metrics

- **Performance Indicators:**
  - Increases in development velocity (commits, features shipped).
  - Treasury stability and capacity for additional initiatives.

- **Stability Metrics:**
  - Minimal market disruption from the gradual release of PHY.
  - Steady or increased trading volume without drastic price shocks.

- **Complexity Reduction:**
  - Single larger capital sum is simpler to manage than multiple small contributions.

- **User Acceptance:**
  - Engagement in DAO discussions and final approval via vote.
  - Positive sentiment observed in community channels and feedback sessions.

- **ETL Reporting Needs:**
  - Quarterly data updates reflecting how SOL is allocated and its impact on growth.
  - Track vesting contract to confirm timely distributions.
