## Summary

This proposal seeks approval to allocate grant to **Physis Labs** for the **Activation Phase**, covering the period immediately following Breakpoint objectives into **January**. This phase focuses on transitioning the Physis ecosystem from validated demonstration into **live operation, onboarding, and sustained network activity**.

The Activation Phase emphasizes real-world deployment, operator onboarding, system hardening, and conversion of ecosystem interest into measurable participation.

## Impact

* **Why Now:**

  * Breakpoint objectives have validated the Physis loop and product readiness.
  * The next critical step is activation: converting proof into live nodes, operators, and activity.

* **Opportunities:**

  * Establish the stable base of active SmartSpot operators.
  * Validate onboarding, monitoring, and update flows under real conditions.
  * Translate ecosystem visibility into sustained participation.

* **Challenges:**

  * Live activation introduces operational complexity not present during demo phases.
  * Early operator experience must be tightly managed to ensure confidence.

* **Future Vision:**

  * A successful Activation Phase positions Physis for broader scale, enterprise engagement, and expansion in 2026.
