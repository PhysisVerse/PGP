## Summary

This proposal seeks approval to release a grant of **700 SOL** from the DAO’s Reserve Treasury to **Physis Labs** to support the **PHYPRIL** campaign and the broader **Q2 2025 execution roadmap**. Funding will directly support the development and rollout of **SmartSpot** and the **SYNCRAL beta**, as well as DAO-wide branding, engagement, and onboarding initiatives.

---

## Impact

- **Why Now:**
  - PHYPRIL marks a critical promotional and development window to amplify the DAO’s mission and execute on Q2 goals.
  - Timely execution requires upfront resource allocation to meet external opportunities and rollout deadlines.

- **Opportunities:**
  - Deliver SmartSpot edge device and SYNCRAL beta to community and developer partners.
  - Expand PHY awareness across Web3, Solana, and relevant ecosystems.
  - Increase contributor onboarding and retention.

- **Challenges:**
  - Without funding, campaign execution and rollout timelines would be delayed or compromised.
  - Inability to meet project and product timelines may undermine visibility and trust.

- **Future Vision:**
  - Success in PHYPRIL and Q2 delivery paves the way for broader SYNCRAL and SmartSpot integration in H2.
  - Expanded brand awareness supports user adoption, future DAO proposals, and ecosystem growth.

---

## Stakeholders

- **Affected Parties:**
  - **PHY Holders**: Benefit from increased visibility and new use cases.
  - **Physis Labs**: Executes development, coordination, and campaign rollout.
  - **DAO Community**: Gains engagement and feature rollouts that advance mission.

- **Engagement for Feedback:**
  - Proposal posted in Council forum.
  - Live feedback session on Matrix.
  - Community input poll on rollout focus areas.

---

## Explanation

- **Concept Introduction:**
  - PHYPRIL is a DAO-wide engagement and milestone month, aligned with Q2 core objectives. The funding supports Physis Labs as it delivers SmartSpot, SYNCRAL beta, PHY outreach, and community onboarding.

- **Implementation Overview:**
  - DAO will issue a grant of **700 SOL** to Physis Labs.
  - Funding will support:
    - Development and infrastructure for SmartSpot and SYNCRAL beta
    - Campaign design and creative assets
    - Technical content and dashboards
    - Bounties, onboarding, contributor coordination

- **Practical Examples:**
  - Short-form content, hackathons, PHY onboarding kits, contributor dashboards, and partner explainer content.
  - Developer support for SmartSpot protocol integration and testing.

- **Addressing Corner Cases:**
  - DAO may require milestone-based reporting.
  - Any unused funds post-June will be earmarked for next phase.

---

## Pitfalls

- **Reasons for Hesitation:**
  - Some may question timing or priority of campaign vs. purely technical development.
  - Treasury risk if additional funds are not tightly scoped.

- **Potential Problems:**
  - Rollout delays or changes in scope could reduce short-term ROI.
  - Reduced external interest if launch windows are missed.

---

## Rationale

- **Optimal Design Justification:**
  - A bundled operations and campaign grant reduces administrative friction and funds mission-aligned outcomes.
  - Clear deliverables (SmartSpot + SYNCRAL beta) make this highly strategic.

- **Considered Alternatives:**
  - Smaller monthly grants, but these may increase overhead and reduce planning efficiency.
  - Postpone campaign funding and prioritize dev-only tasks, which could limit reach.

- **Consequences of Inaction:**
  - Reduced project visibility, slower adoption, and weaker contributor onboarding in Q2.

---

## Queries

- **Pre-Merge Resolutions:**
  - Confirm exact milestones for Q2 reporting.
  - Finalize list of campaign and technical deliverables.

- **Post-Approval Developments:**
  - Launch public-facing PHYPRIL calendar and release schedule.
  - Allocate funds in tranches if needed.

- **Future Considerations:**
  - Evaluate impact of bundled operations and campaign grant model.
  - Consider follow-up proposal for Q3 scaling.

- **Dependencies and Timelines:**
  - Funds must be released by April 5 to meet launch deadlines.
  - Campaign and development deliverables to run April–June 2025.

---

## Deployment

- **User Impact:**
  - Users will gain access to PHY tools, SmartSpot documentation, and SYNCRAL interfaces.
  - Campaign incentives drive retention and governance participation.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - DAO knowledge base updated with PHYPRIL objectives and KPI reports.
  - Grant referenced in quarterly and ecosystem funding logs.

- **Compatibility Considerations:**
  - No system changes required.

- **Reversibility:**
  - Funding tranches may be adjusted if campaign scope changes.

- **Migration Strategy:**
  - Not applicable.
